**Why does the number of acres of forest loss keep counting even when I reload the page? Why doesn’t it reset to 0?**

The forest loss counter stores its data in your browser's local storage. If you want to reset it to 0, you can clear your browser cache.
Remember that stopping deforestation requires consistent efforts—<i>just like clearing your cache requires action on your part.</i>
